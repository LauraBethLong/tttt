<p class="box outline">Hi, I&rsquo;m Laura Beth. I&rsquo;m passionate about the conservative movement, digital influencing, and the intersection of the two. You can <strong><a href="">hire me</a></strong>.</p>
			<h2>My Idea of a Good Day</h2>
			<p class="box shaded">I love organizing a bunch of information into something beautiful, usable, understandable, and persuasive.</p>
			<p>Fill a screen with code and <strong>design</strong> a website, or something for print.</p>
			<p>Wrangle a big spreadsheet to "<strong>keep the trains running on time</strong>."</p>
			<p><strong>Chat with voters</strong> on social media, the phone, or their front porch. Learn what matters to them, and hopefully, help them learn why their support for conservative candidates and causes makes a difference.</p>
			<p>Strategize how to better <strong>collect and use</strong> all this <strong>data and the internet</strong> to connect with voters and win.</p>
			<p>Dig deep into <strong>researching</strong> a candidate or some policy issue. <strong>Write</strong> something about what I learned.</p>
			<p>Go to sleep to <strong>do it all again the next day for a cause I believe in</strong>.</p>
			<p class="box shaded">I&rsquo;m currently considering new projects for 2015 and 2016. How can I help you advance your cause or grow your business? Or just free up some of your time? <a href="">Learn more</a> or <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#108;&#97;&#117;&#114;&#97;&#98;&#101;&#116;&#104;&#108;&#111;&#110;&#103;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;" title="my email address">hire me</a>.</p>
